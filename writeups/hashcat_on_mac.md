# Making hashcat work on Mac

Tested (to a really minimal extent) on an intel Big Sur 11.6.4. This is still a work in progress...

Install using MacPorts

    sudo port install hashcat


Put this in your shell environment

    export OPENCL_ROOT=/opt/local/share/hashcat/OpenCL


This benchmark should then work

    hashcat -b -D 2 -d 3


Running with `/opt/local/share/hashcat/OpenCL` as the PWD can also help in getting certain operations to work
